   Samskrita Agama Pathashale on the mutt premises at 
   Adichunchanagiri.</p>

   political following. Political leaders,
    cutting across party lines and, called on him
     regularly seeking his guidance. Many political
      leaders would call on him before launching the 
      election campaign or political conventions.</p> 

<p class="p2">With the association of State government and different
 religious leaders, Balagangadharanath Swami launched 
 “Karnataka Vanasamvardhana Trust,” to improve the 
 forest wealth by planting five crore saplings. 
 The mutt volunteers under his guidance took up 
 desilting of water tanks as a part of Jalasamvardhana
  scheme to increase the storage capacity of tanks and
   improve ground water level.</p>

<p class="p2">He also rendered yeoman
 service in the health sector, opening hospitals that
  provided free accommodations, treatment and food.</p>

<p class="p2">Under a health programme, trained healthcare
 volunteers visit villages every day, educate,
  guide the patients and bring suffering patients
   to the hospital, get them treated and send them back
    to their places. He also introduced mass marriage
     system to reduce the burden on the economically 
     deprived sections of society. </p>

    When a common man see’s any bird, he feels or 
    desires the same i.e., if I had a wings, I could
     have fly. In this technological world we can
      formulate this delusion come true only by using 
      aeroplanes or helicopters. So, Sri Sri 
      Prakashanantha Swamiji had a lot of trance
       concerning this which came true by the help
        of Maha Swamiji. Due to ill of Maha Swamiji, 
        Sri Sri Prakashnanth Swamiji himself became a 
        pilot and took helicopters for itinerant
         purpose to condense the time duration and 
         agitation of Maha Swamiji for better
